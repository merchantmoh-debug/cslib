# QuickSort on a list

In this file we introduce `quickSort` algorithm that returns a time monad
over the list `TimeM (List α)`. The time complexity of `quickSort` is modeled by the number of comparisons.

## Main results

- `quickSort_correct`: `quickSort` permutes the list into a sorted one.
- `quickSort_time`: The number of comparisons of `quickSort` is at most `n^2` (worst case).
